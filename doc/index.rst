A rudimentary implementation of the `SDMX REST web service <https://github.com/sdmx-twg/sdmx-rest>`_ standard.

This package is developed mainly as an aid for prototyping and testing other code that generates SDMX or relies on SDMX REST web services being available.
It is not currently intended and likely not ready for production use.

The package depends only on:

- `sdmx1 <https://github.com/khaeru/sdmx>`_ —for the SDMX Information Model, file formats, URLs, URNs, and more.
- `starlette <https://www.starlette.io>`_ —as a base web service framework.

It provides a :class:`.Store` class and subclasses for storing the structures and data to be served by an instance.
